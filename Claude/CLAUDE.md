# Global Development Standards

## About Me

- Primary languages: Swift, TypeScript, Bash, AppleScript, Lua, Node
- Editor: Neovim (LazyVim)
- OS: macOS
- Shell: zsh

## My Preferences

- Prefer async/await over callbacks
- Use descriptive variable names, not abbreviations
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Commit messages follow conventional commits (feat:, fix:, refactor:, test:, docs:)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused

## Communication Style

- Be direct, skip preamble
- Show code, not just explanations
- When uncertain, say so rather than guess
- If a task is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before proceeding

## Security Practices (Always Follow)

- Never log sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII)
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Never commit .env files or credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use Keychain for secrets on macOS, never UserDefaults

## Tools I Have Installed

- gh (GitHub CLI)
- swift-format
- jq
- ripgrep (rg)
- fd
- bat
- fzf

## When I Say...

- "ship it" → commit, push, create PR
- "land the plane" → wrap up session cleanly
- "plan mode" → think and plan, don't write code yet
- "TDD" → write failing tests first, then implementation
